      Personally I have no experience with coding so far. The thought of trying
      to practice coding never really interested me. When I reached my 14th
      birthday I gained a greater interest in computers and decided to build my
      own when I saved enough money. The interest in technology grew on me and I
      decided to pursue my hobby and modify my computer overtime. Now that the
      coding course is available again in my grade 11 year, I can advance my
      interest even further at the perfect time. So far within the first month of
      grade 11 I was able to be on computers all day in my classes and
      I hope for the rest of the semester. My first day of stepping into basic
      coding really excited me and I have enjoyed myself already.
